[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shubhamnishad97/shubhamnishad.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shubhamnishad97/badges)

I believe every developer (atleast web developer) should have a place on the net to display or showcase his/her work. [shubhamnishad.com](https://shubhamnishad.com) is my place to showcase different projects and to capture my journey and growth as a Software Developer.

### Technologies used in my site
*   Hugo -- the fastest static site generator made with `go`.
*   Github Pages for free hosting solution.
*   Cloudfare for acting as CDN and also providing free SSL certificate.
*   Travis CI for Continuous Integration and Deployment.
*   Many tweaks for SEO Optimization


### Some special things:
1.One click Deployment:
As soon as I make changes and commit to Github, a build is being started by Travis CI and it generates the pages using the latest Hugo Binary and adds them to the `gh-pages` branch.

2.Faster Pages:
The cloudfare cdn ovides very good pagespeed results and as we have SSL certificate we get higher SEO ranking along with the security features.

3.More Secure:
As this a static site, it is less prone to attacks and also does not slow down with time like a wordpress site.
