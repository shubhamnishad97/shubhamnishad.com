      <description>Simple react app. Find lyrics of songs using Musixmatch api
Site: https://lyrics-search-react.netlify.com/
I made this project to get familiar with react. Context-api is used instead of redux as the project is simple. Bootstrap-MD is used for styling. Axios is used for making all the requests.

How to use:  On the landing page a search component is displayed along with the Top 10 songs of India at that moment.</description>

      <description>QR Code Generator Generate fast and simple QR codes for sharing. Download the extension here

Although this a chrome extension but a web version using the same code is hosted on Github Pages for a quick look. https://shubhamnishad97.github.io/QR-Code-Generator/

I wanted to learn to make extensions from the first time I used one. This extension acted as the perfect idea and hence it was born. This is one part of my QRCode sharing project.</description>

      <description>I believe every developer (atleast web developer) should have a place on the net to display or showcase his/her work. shubhamnishad.com is my place to showcase different projects and to capture my journey and growth as a Software Developer.

Technologies used in my site  Hugo &amp;ndash; the fastest static site generator made with go. Github Pages for free hosting solution. Cloudfare for acting as CDN and also providing free SSL certificate.</description>

      <description>toki-keep-a-note A simple note taking app made with Django. http://toki1.pythonanywhere.com/

Toki is a simple note taking Django project. It was developed to act as a Hands-on and to increase my experience with a MVC framework(MTV as in the case of Django).
I was interested in Django from the first time I searched about and after a little investigation I choose Django as the base for this project.</description>
