I made this project to get familiar with react. Context-api is used instead of redux as the project is simple. Bootstrap-MD is used for styling. Axios is used for making all the requests.

<br>

#### How to use:
1. On the landing page a search component is displayed along with the Top 10 songs of India at that moment.
2. On the search field, you enter the song you want to see the lyrics of.
3. After submitting the form, the matching results will be displayed. Click on the lyrics button of your song.
4. you will be directed to the lyrics page of that song.

<br>

#### What next
This react app can be developed into a full fledged music search engine. Musixmatch api has many functions which can be used to make more a complete application.
