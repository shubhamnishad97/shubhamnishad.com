I completed the Udacity andriod course and decided to make my own app.

<br>
#### **Reasons to make the Scanner app :**

1. The idea did not looked complex for a beginner to implement.
2. I already knew a barcode scanner library which was pretty popular.
3. All the similar apps on playstore had AD'S and I wanted a AD free version.
4. The UI of these apps was also old, not updated for a time now so a Material Design solution was needed.

<br>
#### **The libraries or resources used:**

1. [Zxing-android-embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded): really easy to use and does what it says very efficently.
2. [cupboard](https://bitbucket.org/littlerobots/cupboard): makes SQL vey simple. you should atleast read it usage. [Read this for more info](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Easier-SQL-with-Cupboard)
3. [CodePath Android Cliffnotes](http://guides.codepath.com/android): A crowdsourced resource for complete and up-to-date practical Android developer guides for any topic.
4. youtube also helped as always.

<br>
#### **Things I learned and implemented:**

1. RecyclerView with swipe actions.
2. Database connectivity using SQLite.
3. SharedPreferences.
4. Intents.
5. Countless hours of debugging and wow moments.

<br>

the app is available at https://github.com/shubhamnishad97/ScanBarcode-QRcode/raw/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk
