# QR Code Generator
Generate fast and simple QR codes for sharing. Download the extension [here](https://github.com/shubhamnishad97/QR-Code-Generator/raw/master/QR%20Code%20Generator.crx)


<br>

Although this a chrome extension but a web version using the same code is hosted on Github Pages for a quick look. https://shubhamnishad97.github.io/QR-Code-Generator/

<br>

I wanted to learn to make extensions from the first time I used one. This extension acted as the perfect idea and hence it was born.
This is one part of my QRCode sharing project. The other part is located [here](https://github.com/shubhamnishad97/ScanBarcode-QRcode).

<br>

### Features:
*   Standalone QRcode generation (doesn't depend on external services). 
*   Option to save the generated code as image on local machine.
*   Simple and Intuitive design.
