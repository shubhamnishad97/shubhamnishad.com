### yo this is demo piece
Almost everything we do creates waste, and as a society we are currently producing more waste than ever before. From construction of buildings to driving a car, everything has a waste product associated with it, which over time, we have learnt to deal with, effectively and efficiently. We are very well aware about the waste management schemes applicable in various areas. But, there’s is this one thought that passed my mind the other day when I was just randomly browsing the web -

3,424,971,237 out of 7,432,663,275 people in the world (estd. as of June ‘16), which accounts to almost 46.1% of the population, uses internet DAILY. What kind of waste is produced/generated when we access the internet ? I’m browsing the web at this moment, is it creating a waste by-product ?
And of course then, I started searching, browsing the web and looking for a justified answer to the question that had just crossed my mind. But, days and days passed searching for an answer to this, but I couldn’t find an answer to it.

The internet holds a vast amount of knowledge. As of 2009 digital content was estimated at close to 500 billion gigabytes. According to one article, “If the world’s rapidly expanding digital content were printed and bound into books it would form a stack that would stretch from Earth to Pluto 10 times.” While all those ones and zeroes may not take up quite that much space, it still ends in warehouse rows of server racks housed in data centers. And these data centers are not small facilities that fit in basements, but large buildings filled with computers.

Now, basically, I humbly request all stoppers-by to share their views on this and in the end, I hope to get a satisfactory answer. Together, we can create a new definition to the word INTERNET WASTE.


Cheers!
