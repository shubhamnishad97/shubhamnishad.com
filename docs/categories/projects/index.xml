      <description>Scan Barcode &amp;amp; QR code is a simple and fast code scanner with all the features a modern android app.

I completed the Udacity andriod course and decided to make my own app.

Reasons to make the Scanner app :  The idea did not looked complex for a beginner to implement. I already knew a barcode scanner library which was pretty popular. All the similar apps on playstore had AD&amp;rsquo;S and I wanted a AD free version.</description>

      <description>Simple react app. Find lyrics of songs using Musixmatch api
Site: https://lyrics-search-react.netlify.com/
I made this project to get familiar with react. Context-api is used instead of redux as the project is simple. Bootstrap-MD is used for styling. Axios is used for making all the requests.

How to use:  On the landing page a search component is displayed along with the Top 10 songs of India at that moment.</description>

      <description>QR Code Generator Generate fast and simple QR codes for sharing. Download the extension here

Although this a chrome extension but a web version using the same code is hosted on Github Pages for a quick look. https://shubhamnishad97.github.io/QR-Code-Generator/

I wanted to learn to make extensions from the first time I used one. This extension acted as the perfect idea and hence it was born. This is one part of my QRCode sharing project.</description>

Toki is a simple note taking Django project. It was developed to act as a Hands-on and to increase my experience with a MVC framework(MTV as in the case of Django).
I was interested in Django from the first time I searched about and after a little investigation I choose Django as the base for this project.</description>
